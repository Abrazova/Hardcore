Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
